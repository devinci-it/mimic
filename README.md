# Mimic

Mimic is a tool designed to simplify the learning process of Laravel by providing a streamlined environment for generating scaffolds and experimenting with Laravel commands and concepts. It allows users to mimic Laravel Artisan commands without the need to initialize a full Laravel project in their working directory.

## Installation

Before using Mimic, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Mimic and its dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run Mimic, execute the `run.py` script:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Mimic Artisan Commands

You can mimic Laravel Artisan commands using the Mimic command-line interface. For example:

```bash
mimic make:controller IndexController
```

This command will generate a scaffold for a controller named "IndexController" in the current working directory, mimicking the behavior of the `make:controller` Artisan command in Laravel.

### Additional Options

Mimic supports the following options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Display help message and exit.
- `-f`, `--force`: Force override files if they already exist.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging.

## Configuration

Mimic uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) to customize its behavior. You can adjust settings such as log levels, file paths, and more by editing this file.
